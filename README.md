# Flippr Task

## Introduction

> An integrated realtime dealer-driver assistant webapp constructed using Django Rest Framework and React. The app has a built in JWT authentication which has an enhanced ability to bypass security issues, along with an OTP service combined with a full fledged checkin, checkout and register services.
It utilizes the Django's REST framework to generate an API containing the details of all the users associated with the webapp, and then connects with the frontend React by this API portal.
